# angularUnitTesting

This is the default Angular Project. It is used here to test setup for continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI so that test cases can be automated without the need for anyone to manually run them. See: https://travis-ci.com/
  
Tests to automate are: Unit Tests included in the default package(.spec.ts) and e2e (end to end) tests (.e2e-spec.ts).
